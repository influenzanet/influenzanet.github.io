# Cloze question

Cloze question can create very flexible input by embedding various response fields into a text.
A cloze question is defined defined by a list of [*options*](../option), some can be just a text (with no input) or input field. 
The options are rendered sequentially, producing the text with embedded fields.

As in [choices based question](./choices) the `role` of each option determines the kind of rendered element.

Accepted roles are :

- `text` : A textual part (no input)
- `markdown` : A markdown formatted block of text
- `input`: A text input field
- `dateInput`: A date input
- `numberInput` 
- `lineBreak` 
- `dropDownGroup`: list of choices (`items` property of the options defines the choice list)
