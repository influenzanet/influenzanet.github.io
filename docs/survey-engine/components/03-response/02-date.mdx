Response is encoded as a Unix timestamp

The `dateInputMode` property controls the kind of date to be collected :

- 'YMD' will collect full date (year, month, day)
- 'YM' will collect year and month, response is Unix timestamp of the 2nd day of the month
- 'Y' will collect year, response is the Unix timestamp of the 2nd of January of the selected year.

## Date Input

## YearMonthInput 
<SurveyComponent name="YearMonthInput"/>

## YearInput 
<SurveyComponent name="YearInput"/>
