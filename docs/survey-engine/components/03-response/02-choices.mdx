# Simple choices based components

Choices components collect responses from a set of predetermined choices.
Common implementations are single choices (aka radio button) allowing one choice as response, and multiple choices (aka check boxes) allowing multiple choices as a response.

Available Choices are represented by a list of *option* components. The [Option](../option) page presents the available fields in option

## Single Choice Group

SingleChoice group handles a qualitative input

<SurveyComponent name="singleChoice"/>

## Single Choice Group

Drop down component handles a qualitative input with a drop downn 

<SurveyComponent name="DropDownItem"/>

## Multiple Choice Group

<SurveyComponent name="MultipleChoice"/>

## Multiple Choice with Exclusive option

To build exclusive option, the trick is to set `disabled` property with an expression checking for the response 

<SurveyComponent name="MultipleChoiceExclusive"/>

## Choice associated with a extra field

To achieve this, the `role` field of the option can be change to an input type 
Several roles are available for options:

- 'option': default value, will only show the option label
- 'number': Show an number extra field 
- 'input': 'input',
- 'time': 'timeInput',
- 'date': 'dateInput', // Only available for singleChoice group

`optionProps` field of the option component

<SurveyComponent name="MultipleChoiceOpenItem"/>
