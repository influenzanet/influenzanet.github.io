# Simple choices based components

Choices components collect responses from a set of predetermined choices.
Common implementations are single choices (aka radio button) allowing one choice as response, and multiple choices (aka check boxes) allowing multiple choices as a response.

Available Choices are represented by an *option* component

## Single Choice Group

SingleChoice group handles a qualitative input

<SurveyComponent name="singleChoice"/>

## Multiple Choice Group

<SurveyComponent name="MultipleChoice"/>

## Multiple Choice with Exclusive option

To build exclusive option, the trick is to set `disabled` property with an expression checking for the response 

<SurveyComponent name="MultipleChoiceExclusive"/>
