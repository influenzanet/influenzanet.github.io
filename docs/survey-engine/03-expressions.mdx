# Survey Engine Expressions

import  { ExpressionViewer } from "@site/src/components/survey";

**Expression** are tree structures to represent a set of operations to be evaluated to produce a value (often boolean). They provides dynamic property evaluation for the survey logic.

An **Expression** is a simple structure that can be either:
- A typed literal value (numerical, string)
- A call, with a `name` and a field `data` set of parameters with a list of `Expression`

## Logical Expression

Logical expressions evaluate the logical operations using boolean result of one or several expression evaluated value.
Each expression argument is evaluated and casted as boolean 

- Numerical result :  `true` if > 0, and `false` if <= 0
- String result : `true` if not empty, `false` if empty (=='')

Several operators are avalailble:

- `and`(e1, e2) : AND operator (`true` if e1 is `true` AND if e2 is `true`)
- `or`(e1, e2) : OR operator (`true` if e1 is `true` OR if e2 is `true`)
- `not`(e1): NOT operator (`true` if e1 is `false`, `false` if e1 is `true`)
