# Survey Engine Expressions

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

**Expression** are tree structures to represent a set of operations to be evaluated to produce a value (often boolean). They provides dynamic property evaluation for the survey logic.

An **Expression** is a simple structure that can be either:
- A typed literal value (numerical, string)
- A call, with a `name` and a field `data` set of parameters with a list of `Expression`
